Problem 1:
Considering the following ranges of BMI:
• BMI less than 18.5 = underweight
• BMI 18.5 to <25 = healthy weight
• BMI is 25.0 to <30 = overweight
• BMI 30.0 or higher = obesity
Obtain the mean, median and standard deviation for each of the following groups:
Patients that are underweight, healthy, overweight, and obese.

Problem 2:
Considering the following information about A1C tests:
A normal A1C level is below 5.7%.
A level of 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes.
A level of 6.5% or more indicates diabetes.
Obtain the mean, median and standard deviation for each of the following groups:
Patients that have normal levels of sugar in the blood, patients with prediabetes and
patients with diabetes.

Notes:
• This lab assignment is individual.
• Use the dataset provided in week 2 (diabetes.csv) for both problems.
• Use R and Python to implement the problems.
• For each one of the problems, you need to submit two files (the .R file and the
.ipynb file).
